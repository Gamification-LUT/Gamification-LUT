30/11/2021 15:39:32,5,Due to the novelty of never having experienced manipulating a vehicular simulator,"Eagerness to learn the controls and feel a sense of accomplishment after completing the task. Finding and testing out the optimal way of lifting the substance from the ground and avoiding excess spillage also, in a sense, added to the eagerness to continue through the level.",4,"While conducting the tutorial, I thought I had quickly gotten a good grasp of the controls and each individual movement seemed intuitive to the movements of the joystick. However, when experiencing the different levels, one required a combination of movements such as: 

1. Pushing the joystick in the forward-left corner to gather the most amount of substance into the excavator bucket with only 1 input
2. Pulling both joysticks back simultaneously to lift the substance into the air without spillage 
3. Using a 3-step combination of pushing the bucket into the ground, using the pedals, and moving the left joystick left in order to turn right 

These movements required time and experimentation, of which I had to synthesize previous knowledge from the tutorial and make new entries to my mental dictionary. During this experimentation phase, I became slightly frustrated as I would keep forgetting the basic joystick controls, and had to make micro-movements in each direction to quickly remember them. It came to the point where, instead of understanding why these combinations of control input make the excavator do certain things such as scoop up more substance, I simply accepted the fact that it worked and continued using the method. Upon further reflection after the simulation was over though, I did start to see why these combinations worked. In example 2, the left joystick, when pulled back, would rotate the bucket inward while the right joystick, when pulled back, lifts the arm up, keeping the bucket at an angle where the substance would not spill. As long as one did both inputs simultaneously, the timing of the rotation of the bucket as well as the increase in height would work out perfectly.

Despite the frustration, it was satisfying to have figured out the controls and make use of the mental shortcuts to efficiently move the substance into the hopper, and even more so after figuring out why such combinations worked after the simulation runtime was over. I think I performed decently toward the end regarding the amount of substance I was able to drop into the hopper with each cycle.",4,"The potential of the added challenge as one progressed through the levels was a motivation for me to keep going. However, it was not all too clear to me what the differences were between the levels, as it seemed as though it was the same repeating scooping cycle. There was a noticable change in level 3 though, where one had to now turn toward the hopper and travel there, which employed the 3-step turning maneuver and kept the level engaging.",4,,
